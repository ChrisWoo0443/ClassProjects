# ClassProjects
Projects from AP CompSci and Intro to Java: Object Oriented
All projects are practice


Every program in this folder was created for learning and practicing different skills 

Change.java - used to calculate amount of change needed below one dollar in coins and in increments of 5
		Shows skills in using a scanner and math

Degrees.java - used to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
		Shows basic comprehension of using math in Java

CoffeeCups.java - used to give a target number of coffee cups drank in a day
		Shows basic skill in using a scanner and to taking user input placed in a string

Grades.java - this program is used to take in multiple test scores to provide the average, lowest, highest, and amount of scores.
Shows skill in using a scanner, while loops, basic math, and if statements for processing numbers

Processing Numbers - similar to grades, this program takes in the user inputs to sort the smallest, largest, sum of even numbers and largest even number.
Shows skill in using a scanner, while loops, and multiple if statements used to process a set of numbers given by the user

Login Data Project - this program takes a text file with data and organizes it to be understandable
Shows skill in using arrays and arraylists, taking data from a file, writing multiple methods, creating objects, and accessing methods from a different class

Guessing - this program allows the user to set a maximum and minimum number and guess a number in between. The program tells the user if they are too high or too low. 
Shows skill in using scanners for user input, throwing exceptions, using methods from the math library, and parsing a string to an int

Calculate Math Library - the calculate class has many methods that can be used in a client side class to do certain calculations such as converting degrees to radians, finding the absolute value, finding the maximum number out of a set, etc. 
Shows skill in writing methods, overloading methods, and using algorithms to write code for different types of calculations

Quadratic Describer - this program takes in a quadratic equation from the user and then describes multiple aspects of the equation such as the concavity, axis of symmetry, vertx, and the x and y intercepts.
Shows skill in using a scanner for user input, writing methods to run algorithms, and using two classes (one client side and one for code)


Text Excel - This program creates an excel sheet that a user is able to use to store data and run formulas. 
Shows skill in using multidimensional arrays, arrays, arraylists, inheritance, interfaces, writing methods, scanners for user input, splitting strings, and parsing variables
